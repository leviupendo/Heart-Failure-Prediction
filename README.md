❤️ Heart Failure Prediction

Predicts the likelihood of death from heart failure using clinical patient data and supervised machine learning. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, claiming an estimated **17.9 million lives each year** (WHO). Early detection through predictive modeling can support timely medical intervention and better resource allocation in clinical settings.

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** `GridSearchCV` (5-fold stratified CV) across `C`, `penalty` (L1/L2), `solver`, and `class_weight` (to handle class imbalance — ~32% positive class)
- **Threshold tuning:** Default 0.5 threshold is not always optimal for imbalanced clinical data. We scan the precision-recall curve on the training set and select the threshold that **maximizes F1-score**, balancing false negatives (missed at-risk patients) against false positives.
- **Scaling:** `StandardScaler` applied to continuous features only (binary features left untouched)

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Compare against tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- SHAP values for feature-level interpretability
- Cross-validation on threshold selection (currently tuned on train set only)
- Deploy as a simple Streamlit demo for clinical risk scoring
